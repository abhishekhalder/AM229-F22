Some teams are stronger than others due to reasons such as players' skills, coaching and staff support, amount of practice etc. We want to model each of the $n$ team's ability $a_x \\in [0,1]\\;\\forall x = 1,...,n$. \n\n**The purpose of this problem is to learn the ability vector $a\\in[0,1]^{n}$ from historical game outcome data.** Once determined, we may use $a\\in[0,1]^{n}$ to predict the outcome of a future sports game.\n\n## (a) [50 points] Maximum Likelihood Estimate\n\nWhen teams $x$ and $y$ play each other, the probability that team $x$ wins is equal to $\\mathbb{P}\\left(a_x - a_y + v \\geq 0\\right)$ where the noise $v\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(0,\\sigma^{2}\\right)$, the normal distribution with mean zero and variance $\\sigma^2$. The noise random variable $v$ models things like players' injuries, weather during the game, players' mental stress etc.\n\nSuppose we are given historical game outcome data $\\left(x^{(i)},y^{(i)},z^{(i)}\\right)$ for $i=1,...,m$ games, meaning that game $i$ was played between teams $x^{(i)}$ and $y^{(i)}$, and the result was \n$$z^{(i)} = \\begin{cases}\n+1 & \\text{if team $x^{(i)}$ won},\\\\\n-1 & \\text{if team $y^{(i)}$ won}.\n\\end{cases}$$\nWe assume that there were no ties. We collect this historical data in a matrix $H\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ whose each row denotes a game, and each column denotes a team, i.e.,\n$$H_{ij} = \\begin{cases}\n+z^{(i)} & \\text{if $j=x^{(i)}$},\\\\\n-z^{(i)} & \\text{if $j=y^{(i)}$},\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}$$\nAssuming the outcomes of past games were statistically independent, formulate computing the maximum likelihood estimate of the ability vector $a^{*}_{\\text{MLE}}$ as an optimization problem where matrix $H$ appears as a known parameter. **Explain all mathematical derivation, including why the derived problem is convex**.\n\n**Hints:** You need to derive an optimization problem over the decision variable $a\\in[0,1]^{n}$. If $v\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(0,\\sigma^{2}\\right)$ then $\\frac{v}{\\sigma} \\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, the standard normal distribution. The cumulative distribution function for standard normal distribution is discussed in Lec. 10, p. 14.\n\n## (b) [50 points] Numerical Solution\n\nFix $\\sigma = 0.25$, and $n=10$ teams playing $m=45$ matches in a tournament where each team plays another team once. For row index $i=1,...,m$, the tuple $\\left(x^{(i)},y^{(i)},z^{(i)}\\right)$ are given by the following array of 45 rows and 3 columns:\n$$\\texttt{[1 2 1;\n1 3 1;\n1 4 1;\n1 5 1;\n1 6 1;\n1 7 1;\n1 8 1;\n1 9 1;\n1 10 1;\n2 3 -1;\n2 4 -1;\n2 5 -1;\n2 6 -1;\n2 7 -1;\n2 8 -1;\n2 9 -1;\n2 10 -1;\n3 4 1;\n3 5 -1;\n3 6 -1;\n3 7 1;\n3 8 1;\n3 9 1;\n3 10 1;\n4 5 -1;\n4 6 -1;\n4 7 1;\n4 8 1;\n4 9 -1;\n4 10 -1;\n5 6 1;\n5 7 1;\n5 8 1;\n5 9 -1;\n5 10 1;\n6 7 1;\n6 8 1;\n6 9 -1;\n6 10 -1;\n7 8 1;\n7 9 1;\n7 10 -1;\n8 9 -1;\n8 10 -1;\n9 10 1]}$$\nUse the above data to write a code to first construct the matrix $H\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$, and then compute $a^{*}_{\\text{MLE}}$ in the same code via cvx/cvxpy/Convex.jl. **Please submit your numerically computed $a^{*}_{\\text{MLE}}$ as well as the code.**",
